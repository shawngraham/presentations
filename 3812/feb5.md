That was a remix.

So is this:

Note:

But here the remix is in the code & the source data. The original looks like this:

Note:

So what is a remix, and why are we talking about it in a history class?

What is remix culture?

Lawrence Lessig & the blogosphere of the 00s.

Participatory culture, making culture: coopted by Facebook & google
code is law - remix culture messes with that - so creative commons as a way to complicate that. facebook, youtube, google, hollywood, tv - they all weaponize copyright to try to prevent remix, creative tinkering. cory doctorow: the war on general purpose computing.

mix things - ties us into performance / deformation

> The 're' part is problematic. <br><br> A _mix_ brings something new into being, something new from the source materials _that was always latent_.

Note:

But maybe our sight is diminished through our reliance on texts.

What is the essence of the historical method?

How do you craft an argument from documents?

### One DigHist Approach: Topic Models

- document remixed as distributions of words

- visualizations tend to be network graphs or histograms

Note:
Digital history classes often focus on text analysis like topic models or visual presentation of textual materials into a kind of public history exhibit space on line. But I think this misses what digital history _could_ be.

<section data-background="3812/jonny-hayes-427303.jpg">

Note:
How do you make an argument from that? It's already really weird. (image- all at sea, lost, how to find your way?)

We know one way: to graph it. Graphs are so familiar, we forget that they are a _mix_ of elements. In this case, they make the conceptually hard part of a topic model safe by wrapping it in something familiar.

---

This is, in some respects, an error.

What else might be see if we _accepted_ the weirdness of the algorithm?

Remix it.

_What does that mean_?

[Deformance & Interpretation, McGann and Samuels](http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/jjm2f/old/deform.html)

"reading backwards 'short circuits' our usual way of reading a text and 'reinstalls the text - any text, prose or verse - as a performative event, a made thing' (Samuels & McGann 30). Reading backwards revitalizes a text, revealing its constructedness, its seams, edges, and working parts" - Mark Sample

"I want to propose a theory and practice of a Deformed Humanities.<Br> A humanities born of broken, twisted things.<br> And what is broken and twisted is also beautiful, and a bearer of knowledge.<br> The Deformed Humanities is an origami crane - <br>a piece of paper contorted into an object of startling insight and beauty."<br> - Mark Sample

Note:

Sample argues that deformance is more acceptable b/c of the performance side of things rather than the deformity side. Here he differs. He wants us to embrace the broken

Note:
"The Deformed Humanities—though most may not call it that—will prove to be the most vibrant and generative of all the many strands of the humanities. It is a legitimate mode of scholarship, a legitimate mode of doing and knowing. Precisely because it relies on undoing and unknowing." http://www.samplereality.com/2012/05/02/notes-towards-a-deformed-humanities/

Note:
Where does a deformation fit on our grid of forces for the ontology of things we created last week?

>The real breakthrough will come when the data that represent the 'recorded' sound are manipulated as data, in the numerical domain, to later produce something else other than an analog of the original sound. (Rothenbuhler and Peters 247)
