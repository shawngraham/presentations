	<h3> Virtual Worlds<br> of the Past</h3>
	<h4> an intro to games/history </h4>

## Module 3
_digital things to digital worlds_

Note:
Immersion: or, how do you natively engage with digital objects about the past?
Answer: perhaps with the medium most appropriate

Agenda

- defining a game
- how playfulness & history intersect
- playing the past

Note:
old intro ppt

Agenda cont

- categorizing immersive experiences
- some video game theory
- ARGs the Killer App

Note:
old session 2, also ARGs. maybe this should be in march 5th. Actually, maybe I could switch up March 5th, do ABM?
dare I try the original problem space? maybe just convert it to pdf, show if necessary. it could lead to

>Games are... the most ancient and time-honored vehicle for education. They are the original educational technology, the natural one, having received the seal of approval of natural selection.

Note:
Who is Chris Crawford?
First Quote continues: We don’t see mother lions lecturing cubs at the chalkboard; we don’t see senior lions writing their memoirs for posterity. In light of this, the question, “Can games have educational value?” becomes absurd... Game-playing is a vital educational function for any creature capable of learning 
	(Chris Crawford 1982). 
All games: four qualities- representation, interaction, conflict, safety
-representation: all games are about something else; games model external situations. not faithful 1:1, but are subjective.
-interaction- crucial to appeal of games. Player must be able to influence the world of the game & get meaningful responses
-conflict- there is a goal, blocked by obstacles. Can be direct or indirect, violent or nonviolent
-safety- conflict in games does not carry the same consequences those conflicts would have in real world- thus they are safe ways of experiencing real situations

MDA Model
Three dimensions to measure a game along 
([Robin Hunicke, Marc LeBlanc, Robert Zubeck](http://www.cs.northwestern.edu/~hunicke/MDA.pdf))

+ Mechanics
+ Dynamics
+ Aesthetics

Not the only scheme out there; but useful to begin with

Note:
Mechanics- basic rules and code of a game. Now what we see or hear while playing a game, rather, the information that goes into constructing  the world of the game: algorithms to control AI, for instance
Dynamics: the way the game play emerges from the mechanics- the events that actually occur, or can occur, during the course of the game as experienced by the player.
Aesthetics: the emotional responses evoked in the player as he or she interacts with the games: sensation; fantasy; narrative; challenge; fellowship; discovery; expression; submission (game as pasttime)

Note:
So why do historians care?
Jeremiah McCall on what games/simulations are for?
-pose meaningful questions about peoples of the past
Evaluate sources and analyze the evidence they provide about the past
Discriminate between the essential and trivial components of a historical event, its potential causes, its effects
Analyze dynamic systems: the interrelationships between humans, humans & enviornmnet; and how these relationships influence human actions
Adopt, in order to gain insight, the perspective of individuals from the past
Combine pieces of evidence into plausible interpretations of the past that offer clear considerations of potential causes/effects and are situated in historical contexts.
Understanding that all reconstructions of the past are interpretations: provisional, standing or falling on the strength of evidence and arguments, subject to revisions, and very much dependent on the historians who create them.
-history thus becomes a lens through whcih they can view the world.

#### Why do we play games?
<p class="fragment fade-up">  For the pleasure of finding out <br> what happens next</p>

Note:
why do players play?
what happens next?
what happens if I do this?

---

### In many ways, the same motivation for historians:
+ What happened then?
+ Why did it happen?
+ To play a game successfully, the gamer has to learn why things happen the way they do in order to win
+ To be a successful historian, the historian has to learn why things happened the way they did

Note:
Simulations are superior tools for learning about historical context, historical systems, and historical limitations.
Simulation games remedy the forgetfulness of context and the functioning systems that encompassed people of the past.: it putts students into dynamic recreations of roles and situations from the past- puts students at center of complex systems where a variety of variable factors ebb/flow simultaneously in ways that cannot be readily represented in other media.
-to analyze a system, use a roughly analogous but simplified model of the system.

Note:
Simulation games are interpretations, not oracles
They are interpretations that encourage historical questions

### Procedural Literacy<br> Procedural Rhetorics

Note:
So you need to have _procedural literacy_; you need to understand _procedural rhetorics_. 

the mechanisms of the game = the historiographic tradition

(see also Claudio Fogu, "Digitalizing Historical Consciousness" History & Theory, Vol. 48, No. 2, May, 2009 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-2303.2009.00500.x/pdf )

What (historical) games have you played?<br> What made them historical? <br> What made them good?

Note:
genres are marketing categories. A typology should help you understand something fundamental, to situate this game relative to that game can also help to know how scholars have studied things

<div align="left">
Ludology: The study of games. Also: The study of games as a unique field, especially as distinct from narrative). <br>
<br>
Ludus - rule-based games (Space Invaders!)<br>
Paidea - free-form games (GTA!)
<br><br>
Narratology: the study of storytelling; the study of games as story systems.

More useful: a typology of time and space

![](3812/typology.png)![](3812/typologyinuse.png)

<div align="left">When you can classify, you can judge when/how/if a particular game/representation is suited to a particular purpose- or the purposes to which such a game is being put.

Note:


---

Let's classify some games you know.

Note:
-how can some ways of representing time/space in a game correspond with various historical episodes?
-have them think of a game they know well, categorize it
- Final word to Claudio Fogu: In the video-game epic mode, gone are the historic event and the historic site. The digitalization of history in video games thus brings together spatialization, virtualization, and simulation to complete the elimination of representation as the medium that anchored historical action to historical consciousness. – Fogu, 121

### Alternate Reality Games

Perhaps the best mode for the historian?

Note:
Ergodic texts
Hypertext
Oulipo
Literary Hoaxes
‘found footage’
Amongst many other vectors that make the idea of an ‘alternate reality game’ something possible

### Ergodic Texts 

Note:
- *"require performance to be understood" aarseth* focus on "mechanical organization of text". ergon, work, hodos, path. effort to traverse text both for understanding also in construction/unfolding. aarseth 1997. The most famous example is the Choose Your Own Adventure series (Edward Packard et al, 1979ff), which are both played and read at the same time. Published for a children’s audience, and beloved by ARG designers and players alike, these books reared two generations on both hypertext and the practice of reading a story as game/game as story. A similar group of books is the Fighting Fantasy series (1980ff), which let readers jump from page to page by dice rolls as well as choices. Espen Aarseth describes these influential texts as “ergodic”, requiring work (“erg”) to read. Like ARGs, “playing” ludic texts is essential to reading them. Unlike a traditionally linear text, like a Shakespearean history play, with a one-way track through events, the reader must choose a path through alternatives

Note:
2001
Certain letters circled on some posters
A line in the credits for: 
 Jeanine Salla, "Sentient Machine Therapist."
This becomes the ‘rabbit hole’ for a murder mystery. ‘this is not a game’ is a recurring phrase on websites, profiles, etc that seem to be related to the mystery.
Took place across 30 websites – ad hoc group of players calling themselves ‘cloudmakers’ solved it

+ An elaborate backstory & consuming narrative
+ Series of transmedia puzzles and challenges to move the story forward
+ Played in parallel to everyday reality; players become aware gradually of what’s going on, form communities to unravel the story

Is it right to screw with history? 
Can hoaxes, lies, and conspiracy elicit broader truths?
What happens if you don’t recognize that this is not a game?

### ARGS for History: The Killer App

Of value to historians for:

+ Immersive, authentic experience
+ Have to think like a historian to succeed
+ Allows multiple viewpoints, inhabit multiple viewpoints
+ Emergent meaning making

Note:
+ Appropriate medium given this world of ubiquitous computing?
+ Dangers for historians?
	+ allegories of control, illumination, of unknowing masses... 
MacDougall & Campeau write:
Instead  of telling a story," says author and ARG designer Sean Stewart, "we ... present the evidence of that story, and let the players tell it to themselves." Elsewhere, Stewart has called this process “storytelling as archaeology—or possibly, the other way around.”

What Stewart describes, of course, is very close to the process of real historical research…. Historical research is the game.
