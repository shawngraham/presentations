<h1 style="color:#000"> Picture it,<Br> Bohemia, 15th century <h1>

Note:
Central Europe. Complicated pattern of ethnicities, alliances, marriages, and bloodlines. Czechs (Bohemians), Hungarians, German speakers. Religious reformation is in the air. Power is up for grabs. Catholics and Protestants. Who gets to speak for god; who gets to commune. A horribly complicated and complex time.

Note:
note how the relationship between W and S is framed. S is foreign... in game play, his troops are all *not* bohemian...he's portrayed as hungarian, though no less bohemian than his brother

Note:

Reid McCarter puts it well: "As a portrait of Central Europe’s late medieval period, Deliverance also makes a series of decisions as to what is and isn’t historically important to its vision of the past."  

He goes on to say: Retelling history is always a process of choosing which facts to highlight. It’s impossible to show the entire scope of human experience. What’s given weight – or omitted entirely – says more about a historian’s interests than anything else. This is doubly so in the case of historical fiction like Deliverance, which has to decide, from centuries of Central European history, what warrants representation."

So they are making a claim to historical authenticity! What does 'authenticity' look like here?.

What do they choose to represent? <Br><Br> Quick! To the Googles!

Note:
in class exercise. tabulate on the board. prompt them to focus on *who* gets represented, and *how*. Who is the villain? Why?

In previous class, I focused on mechanics as being the most important part of a game for history. Today, we're focusing on representation as being the most important part of a game for history.

Note:
Europe was a melting pot. Andalusia. Italy. Byzantium. Mongols. North Africans. Race wasn't conceived of the way Modernity did for us. But it's interesting how the developers dismissed concerns, and how this person was attacked. Why?

###"The question becomes, in Kingdom Come: Deliverance and historical fiction in general: what kind of past do audiences want to remember?"


Note:
Reid McCarter again: "The suspicion, given the murkiness of the historical record regarding a rural stretch of medieval Central Bohemia’s demographic make-up, is not just that it’s possible that non-ethnically Czech people could have been present in a “historically accurate” game, but why excluding them is so important to Deliverance’s take on history.

The only reason that seems to fit is that Deliverance selects from the past what best serves an exclusionary, xenophobic vision of Czech history – one that considers ethnic and linguistic minorities a historical detriment. Far from a removed question of what did or didn’t happen centuries ago, Deliverance’s vision of 15th Century Bohemia suggests a continuity of history that says the Czech Republic is for ethnically Czech citizens only."

Qs of representation to think about when you play a 'historical' game:

- who is the villain?
- who is the hero?
- who _matters_ to the story?
- who is left out?

---

Qs of mechanics to think about:

- are these actions reasonable in the context of this era?
- are these actions meaningful within the context of the game (do they carry consequences)?

Critical Play:

- in pairs: one plays [Path of Honours](http://www.philome.la/gamingthepast/path-of-honors-1-12-18/play), and 'talks aloud' about what they are doing and why, 5 minutes. The other observes the play, paying attention to what the player does versus what the player says
- 5 minute debrief

- reverse roles. Play [Destory History](http://philome.la/lucaswcoyne/destory-history-v10).

- make notes re what you observe about history & games in your module 3 github logs

- what kinds of authenticity are at play? cui bono?
