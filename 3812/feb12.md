Note:
- module 2 work due date: Before class on Feb 26th
- if you're not happy with your model, you may look at the other models made by this class and choose to work with one of those as the basis for your remix (see FAQ).
  - NOTE: your object biography needs to discuss the implications of that choice
- grading of module 1: I'm reweighting the first two elements

Note:
- process: shellac, then plaster applied small amount at a time. then removed and reassembled. inner sides coated with shellac. can take a year to make; but can be reused over and over. images https://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/sculpture/creation/mould.htm

Note:
- private collectors
- creation of canon
  - foundation of national/royal academies of arts
  - ties to nationalism, emerging of nation states

Atelier de Moulage

Cast Courts, Great Exhibition 1855

Note:
Napoleonic invasions of italy, egypt etc, bringing home not just copies but originals

## Industrialization

Cast courts at the V&A open in 1873

Note:
- setting tastes
- applied arts and crafts
- V & A Museum- originally Museum of Manufactures "The 'improvement of public taste in Design' and the 'application of fine art to objects of utility' which were among the Museum's primary aims meant that casts of architectural and ornamental work were necessary educational tools" http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/the-cast-courts/

## Industrialization of Academia

<section data-background="3812/simone-hutsch-468080.jpg">

Note:

- 19th c drive for classification, standardization, systemization
- allowing study of 1:1 copies, thus opening scholarship: the originals were scattered through practice of partage etc
- allowing reassembly of scattered collections
- also tool of diplomacy: remember about the King of Naples and the casts of the dead?
- 'encyclopedic museum' largely impossible w/o plaster casts

## Museo della Civilta' Romana

Note:
possible to take screenshots such that you could build a model from this. Mussolini's purpose in doing this

## Casts to Cast-offs

"Whether seen as dead bodies, cheap replicas, or dusty specimens, the casts were no longer awarded any artistic value"

Note:
- too much democracy! elites redefine what it means to 'consume' antiquity. high quality casts meh, actual objects instead. something that the masses can't obtain
- also earlier trends in eg literature associate palor of the casts with death
- museums become not sites of democracy but sites of cultural hegemony

## Redemption

Peplos Kore, Museum of Classical Archaeology, Cambridge

Note:
Re-evaluation since the 1970s. Sometimes the casts the best record of antiquities since degraded by pollution or war
- 19th C idea of 'genius', or 'originality' - which emerges in opposition to an era where industrial scale cheap reproductions first become possible - no longer as big a deal.
- contemporary artists etc embrace idea of simulacra, copies, 'works without authorship'
- teaching value still holds

## Which brings us back to the Digital

And How Have Museums Dealt With This?

Note:
mass 3d digital copies only just emerged - like the last five - seven years. Each year gets easier and easier to do. who managed to make a model within a museum?

3d a 'non rivalrous good', can be distributed without depleting the amount of 'original'

## Problems for museums

- will they allow models and modeling?
- will they allow data to be downloaded?
- will they allow data to be remixed?
- will they charge a fee?

Note:
for the museum, the exact answer to this question depends on the circumstances under which the museum 'collected' the materials in the first place!
- but what's legal doesn't nec'y = what's right, of course...

## Quick: What's the position of Canadian Museums?

---
## The bigger fear:

# Misuse

Note:
like white supremacists appropriating models to create offensive artwork. how could museums specify under what aesthetic or political conditions work could be reused? Do any museums do so? imagine anne frank museum.
- Carter's point about the maori seeing no distinction between the thing and the copy...
- seems impossible. but let's imagine more narrow idea of 'misuse' as say making many many copies - maybe selling as trinkets? The article argues need to consider the incentive structures towards this misuse, and framing the discussion in the same tunes that say music is pirated misunderstands the nature of the data. also, the audience for 3d digital data from museums not much prone to illegality, per the article. I wonder.
- ultimately museums have a duty to make their materials as widely available as possible especially when we consider the damage that collecting those materials may have done in the first place. the duty to share outweighs the problems of sharing

## answering these questions requires _infrastructure_

concerning

(a) recording methods and metadata,
(b) digital object discovery and access,
(c) citation of digital objects,
(d) analysis and study,
(e) digital object reuse and repurposing,
(f) the critical role of a national/international digital archive.

### Developing a 3-D Digital Heritage Ecosystem: from object to representation and the role of a virtual museum in the 21st century

Michael carter points out the problem of the loosened copy...

Let's take [a look at his presentation from CAA 2017](http://www.academia.edu/31909196/THE_LIFE_OF_ATTRIBUTES_META_AND_PARADATA_AS_3D_POINT_AND_OBJECT_DNA_FOR_HERITAGE_PROVIDENCE)

Note:

Carter states:
"To a point, many steps removed, the heritage object has lost any and all meaning; traded, bartered or sold without consideration of the cultural, historical or heritage value or agency it held...""

"There have been strong opinions on how we should handle digital heritage objects. We know that the Maori for instance, do not distinguish between the physical or digital representation of the same object, both maintaining agency and intentionality. So there is a duty of care when we make and handle 3D objects"

Carter: "Using LatourÕs notion of ANT, in which points are both individual actors and part of a community of actors, our goal is to embed providence information such as ORCID or DOI, as well as the creatorÕs signature within the model as it is birthed into the wild. Further provenance data, such as paradata, object metadata as well as a means such as blockchain or checksum to give the ability to determine if the model has been altered as it is appropriated and repurposed after its initial birth."
