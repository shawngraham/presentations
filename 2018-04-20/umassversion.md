### My Name Is Shawn Graham
## and I am a Failure

Note:
the hook- why is he a failure? what does that even mean? note training as roman archaeologist vs my actual work history. note that blogging in the early 00s was a way for me to feel less like a failure - on the internet, in those days, no one knew you were a dog... so I let it all hang out there. but I want to focus on two particular failures, and why they failed.

### Failure is not the end.


Note:
my training, as a teacher. If i can do this, untenured, contingent, and still survive then there is hope for everyone. I will discuss later how my despair at the loss of heritagecrowd taught me something profound about teaching. But I will tell you now that I'm still wrestling with what the wrestlers taught me - about empathy, about kindess, and about expectations. These two experiences are perhaps the most formative of my evolution as a scholar.

## What are the stakes?

"In DH we often valorize failure and what can be learned from it, but it can be difficult to know how to deal with the feelings associated with it...""<br><Br> - Brandon Walsh

Note:

He goes on to say: Beyond the content we teach and the act of learning it - our students are living in states of continual anxiety. To say nothing of the personal, social, or systemic traumas to which many of them have been subjected about which we may never know

this is how I failed Marc in the welding class. re my current students - "If I wanted to study computers I wouldn't be taking history". How do I deal with the anxiety now? By focussing on process, rather than product. By insisting on full documentation of what they're doing, _why_ they're doing it, and how they see it _intersecting_ what they read, and their other classes.

## But I'm Not Techy!

_confession time_

Note:
shawn as undergrad student with snarky paper. Doing digital work, thinking digitally, does NOT mean you have to be 'techy', whatever that means.

## Digital Work is about <Br> Failing in Public

+ failing in public goes against all your training. So why bother?
+ how do you do that _productively_?
+ how do you do it _safely_?
+ and how do you _teach_ it?

Note:
It means that you are actually aware of the processes surrounding the context(s) of your work, and being critically reflective about them. White guy on the internet warnings.

---

## Everyone Screws Up.
### Some are better at hiding it

![img](failpics/academic-jargon.jpg)

Note:
Framing fail in research & professional practice. tendency to spin, frame as win ; leads to inflated claims of success; to value fail means to not play the academic game as we currently find it.

## Croxall and Warnick's <br> Taxonomy of Fails

1 - Technological Failure<br>
2 - Human Failure<br>
3 - Failure as Artifact<br>
4 - Failure as Epistemology<br>

Note:
taxonomy. a strategy for productive fails. move from types 1 & 2 to types 3 & 4. continue the parable of heritagecrowd, the welders: the reporting back, the warts-and-all!
Croxall and Warnick, working from the perspective of digital pedagogy, identify 4 kinds of fail
1-4, with examples - one thing not mentioned in any of this is the whiteness and maleness of the internet, and of internet culture. It might be that everything I’m saying is impossibly tainted by the fact I’m a white guy in tech: and I don’t have the necessary perspective to work out whether or not what I’m saying is dangerous or not.
-The first two refer to what happened; the second two refer to our response and how we react to the first two (*if* we react at all). Perhaps there should be a 5th category: 5 - failing to reflect.
set up your learning so that fails 1 and 2 happen, but the *real* learning happens if you can move 'em to 3 and 4!

## Quinn Dombrowski on Fails

Tech fails• Career planning fails• Communication fails• Strategic fails• Arbitrary ( job market) fails• Failures to probe assumptions• Failures to acknowledge change• Failures to forge a shared vision• Failures to do right by others

---

Failure to do right by others.

Note:
Not everyone can fail in public the way I can. You really gotta think about how 'fail' is personally situated and you, as a prof, likely have no idea what the actual risks are for your students.
One way I suggest for shifting some of the risks to personal security is to frame the work within this discussion of the kind of fail with which we’re dealing. The second part is to move the discussion toward fail as something  we  study  (rather  than  something  inherent  to  us),  and  then  to  a  process,  to  a  way  we  iterate  through  what  we  study.

## So Let's<br> Fail Gloriously<br> Together

Any students here? Imagine you were told to go adapt this:

[https://github.com/msu-anthropology/daea-fs16](https://github.com/msu-anthropology/daea-fs16)

for your own work. Where do you start? How do you start?

Note:
Imagine you're given this link and told to go adapt it to your own project. Where do you start? How do you do it?

## In what ways have we failed?
<Br><Br>

+ How did _I_ fail?
+ How did _you_ fail?

<br>
Is 'fail' the right word here?

Note:
digital work is a team sport btw

## Let's try again.

keep process notes, document blind alleys. cite your notes in your papers! surface the hard work of going down blind alleys

### What makes something DH-y?

## Justification versus Discovery

h/t [Trevor Owens](http://www.trevorowens.org/2012/11/discovery-and-justification-are-different-notes-on-sciencing-the-humanities/)

Note:
archaeology had its moment about 20 odd years ago re computation: computation was there to *prove* something! it was all hypothesis testing, sampling strategies, models and the goal: 'mid range theory', something that would bridge the fragmentary evidence to the grand stories about the past we wanted to tell. the archaeology wars were bitter, divisive. there are still the true believers out there, but most now recognize that you do all of these things in a framework of interpretation, that the computation doesn't *prove* anything, in and of itself. instead, it helps tell better v worse stories. the DH versionn of this summed up in this lovely aphorism of trevor owens.

DH is about discovery

Discovery is about exploration

When we explore we sometimes encounter blind allies

Exploration is necessarily about failure

Note:
'exploration' in a 'TS Elliot, four quartets', know the place for the first time' sense, rather than in a colonial sense.

## 'But We Already Knew That!'

<br><br><br>Let's take a look at the work of [Matthew Lincoln](https://matthewlincoln.net/2015/03/21/confabulation-in-the-humanities.html) <br> and how he deals with this.

Note:

digital work suffers from this problem, of differentiating what sounds reasonable from what we already knew. let's take a look at what matthew lincoln says... it's a similar approach to what is being proposed in science papers, of 'preregistering' (there it's to combat fraud and p-hacking)

---

## What I've learned about <br>Failing Gloriously
#### or, 'productive failure as pedagogy'

- frameworks and scaffolds
- physical/digital spaces for explorations
- appropriate eyes and audiences
- uncoverage rather than coverage

---
### Academia is not set up to valorize 'failure'

---

<br><br><br><h2 style="color:black">20 000 articles, and no fail</hr>
<h4><a href="http://graeworks.net/digitalarchae/20000/"> corpus here </a>
<section data-background="failpics/streamgraph-topics-20000.png">

Note:
Do we *ever* talk about research that *doesn’t* confirm an hypothesis? Do we *ever* try to replicate someone else’s study? - 20 000 articles topic model - No topic that explicitly deals with something *not* working - This, despite the processual turn, where you might’ve expected such a beast!

## The Lunatick Moment

_...or, moving from 'failure' to Failing Gloriously!_

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>![redemption1](failpics/redemption1.png)</th>
    <th align="top">![redemption2](failpics/redemption2.png)</th>
  </tr>
</table>

Note:
-despair post & the response & the framing of what I was doing as perhaps more akin to Bethany’s ideas about our ‘lunatic’ moment. does that moment still exist? I hope it does

### Brandon Walsh - 'Frustration is a Feature'

> In DH we often valorize failure and what can be learned from it, but it can be difficult to know how to deal with the feelings associated with it...<br><Br> Beyond the content we teach and the act of learning it - our students are living in states of continual anxiety.

### The <Br>Humane<br> Hack <br><br> Alan Liu
</div>
Note:
digital work suffers from being seen as 'cool' or the 'next big thing' or the 'saviour of the humanities'. Lots of people get their knickers in a twist over this. This goes back to what Alan Liu argued about the laws of 'cool' in 2004, of how 'knowledge work' was the 'cool' work, in that it couldn't really be defined. We only know cool when we see it. Hence, 'cool' is the aporia of information: 'cool is information designed to resist information'. Thus, it's also shallow.

students - go see how your artist peers deal with their work. study how artistic practice offers models for dealing with the problems of tech - we need to fold artistic ways of knowing into our practice - to my mind, an experimental process based, fail based, way of knowing. that's how we deal with the 'cool' of tech.

<section data-background="drew/senjuti-kundu.png"></section>
<div align="right">
You are allowed <Br>to take pleasure <br>in what you learn, <Br>and<br> in how you learn it, <br> as you break things.
</div>

To fail _gloriously_ is to use your own position, as you are able, to make it safe for someone more precarious than you to find similar joy.

Note:
Anxiety is a feature; embrace the disorientation, and use the technology to find each other!

_thank you_
