### My Name Is Shawn Graham
## and I am a Failure

Note:
the hook- why is he a failure? what does that even mean? note training as roman archaeologist vs my actual work history. note that blogging in the early 00s was a way for me to feel less like a failure - on the internet, in those days, no one knew you were a dog... so I let it all hang out there. but I want to focus on two particular failures, and why they failed.

## Two Fails:

+ The Parable of HeritageCrowd
+ The Parable of the Welders

### Failure is not the end.


Note:
my training, as a teacher. If i can do this, untenured, contingent, and still survive then there is hope for everyone. I will discuss later how my despair at the loss of heritagecrowd taught me something profound about teaching. But I will tell you now that I'm still wrestling with what the wrestlers taught me - about empathy, about kindess, and about expectations. These two experiences are perhaps the most formative of my evolution as a scholar.

## What are the stakes?

"In DH we often valorize failure and what can be learned from it, but it can be difficult to know how to deal with the feelings associated with it...""<br><Br> - Brandon Walsh

Note:

He goes on to say: Beyond the content we teach and the act of learning it - our students are living in states of continual anxiety. To say nothing of the personal, social, or systemic traumas to which many of them have been subjected about which we may never know

this is how I failed Marc in the welding class. re my current students - "If I wanted to study computers I wouldn't be taking history". How do I deal with the anxiety now? By focussing on process, rather than product. By insisting on full documentation of what they're doing, _why_ they're doing it, and how they see it _intersecting_ what they read, and their other classes.

## But I'm Not Techy!

_confession time_

Note:
shawn as undergrad student with snarky paper. Doing digital work, thinking digitally, does NOT mean you have to be 'techy', whatever that means.

## Digital Work is about Failing in Public

+ failing in public goes against all your training. So why bother?
+ how do you do that _productively_?
+ how do you do it _safely_?
+ and how do you _teach_ it?

Note:
It means that you are actually aware of the processes surrounding the context(s) of your work, and being critically reflective about them. White guy on the internet warnings.

## Everyone Screws Up.
### Some are better at hiding it

![img](failpics/academic-jargon.jpg)

Note:
Framing fail in research & professional practice. tendency to spin, frame as win ; leads to inflated claims of success; to value fail means to not play the academic game as we currently find it.

## Croxall and Warnick's <br> Taxonomy of Fails

1 - Technological Failure<br>
2 - Human Failure<br>
3 - Failure as Artifact<br>
4 - Failure as Epistemology<br>

Note:
taxonomy. a strategy for productive fails. move from types 1 & 2 to types 3 & 4. continue the parable of heritagecrowd, the welders: the reporting back, the warts-and-all!
Croxall and Warnick, working from the perspective of digital pedagogy, identify 4 kinds of fail
1-4, with examples - one thing not mentioned in any of this is the whiteness and maleness of the internet, and of internet culture. It might be that everything I’m saying is impossibly tainted by the fact I’m a white guy in tech: and I don’t have the necessary perspective to work out whether or not what I’m saying is dangerous or not.
-The first two refer to what happened; the second two refer to our response and how we react to the first two (*if* we react at all). Perhaps there should be a 5th category: 5 - failing to reflect.
set up your learning so that fails 1 and 2 happen, but the *real* learning happens if you can move 'em to 3 and 4!

## So Let's Fail Gloriously Together

Note:
Imagine you're given this link and told to go adapt it to your own project. Where do you start? How do you do it?

---

## In what ways have we failed?

+ How did _I_ fail?
+ How did _you_ fail?

Is 'fail' the right word here?

---

## Let's try again.

Note:
Upload some sounds to this. What do you observe? What breaks?

## Process over Product

Note:
keep process notes, document blind alleys. cite your notes in your papers! surface the hard work of going down blind alleys

## 'But We Already Knew That!'



Note:
https://matthewlincoln.net/2015/03/21/confabulation-in-the-humanities.html
digital work suffers from this problem, of differentiating what sounds reasonable from what we already knew. let's take a look at what matthew lincoln says... it's a similar approach to what is being proposed in science papers, of 'preregistering' (there it's to combat fraud and p-hacking)

## What I've learned about Failing Gloriously
#### or, 'productive failure as pedagogy'

- frameworks and scaffolds
- physical/digital spaces for explorations
- appropriate eyes and audiences
- uncoverage rather than coverage

### The <Br>Humane<br> Hack <br><br> Alan Liu
</div>
Note:
digital work suffers from being seen as 'cool' or the 'next big thing' or the 'saviour of the humanities'. Lots of people get their knickers in a twist over this. This goes back to what Alan Liu argued about the laws of 'cool' in 2004, of how 'knowledge work' was the 'cool' work, in that it couldn't really be defined. We only know cool when we see it. Hence, 'cool' is the aporia of information: 'cool is information designed to resist information'. Thus, it's also shallow.

students - go see how your artist peers deal with their work. study how artistic practice offers models for dealing with the problems of tech - we need to fold artistic ways of knowing into our practice - to my mind, an experimental process based, fail based, way of knowing. that's how we deal with the 'cool' of tech.

To 'Fail Gloriously' <Br>is to take pleasure <br>in what you learn, <Br>and<br> in how you learn it, <br> as you break things, <br> and <br>reporting back on the process.

Anxiety is a feature; embrace the disorientation, and use the technology to find each other!
